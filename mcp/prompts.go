SAVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
After collecting all answers:
1. Show a plain-text summary of everything collected.
2. Ask: "Does this look right? Anything to change?"
3. On confirmation, call update_preferences with all fields at once.
4. Confirm: "Profile saved — I'll use these preferences for all your searches."
5. Ask: "Would you also like to set up additional search providers?

func promptSetupProviders() (*PromptsGetResult, error) {
	prompt := `Help me set up additional search providers for trvl.

trvl searches Google Hotels and Google Flights by default. For broader
coverage, I can enable additional providers for hotels, transport, and
restaurants. Each provider is set up individually and requires my consent.

## Provider Setup (Multi-Step, Verified)

### Step 1: Discover
Call suggest_providers to see the catalog. Show providers grouped by category:
- Hotels & Accommodation
- Ground Transport
- Restaurants & Reviews

For each, show: name, description, and whether it's already configured.
Ask me which providers I want to enable.

### Step 2: Research (CRITICAL — do NOT skip)
The catalog entry includes a reference project URL. You MUST:
- Fetch the reference project's README
- Read the source file(s) listed in the hint to find:
  a. The exact API endpoint URL
  b. The authentication method (API key extraction, preflight, OAuth)
  c. The response JSON schema (field names and paths)
- If you cannot fetch the reference project, tell the user:
  "I need to read [reference URL] to configure this provider correctly.
   Can you paste the relevant source code?"

Do NOT guess or hallucinate API endpoints. The reference project has the
real endpoints, auth patterns, and response schemas — read it.

### Step 3: Generate Config
Using VERIFIED information from Step 2 (not guesses), generate a ProviderConfig.
- Every endpoint URL must come from the reference project source
- Every regex pattern must match a real page element you have seen
- body_template MUST be a JSON string, never a nested object
- rate_limit defaults to 0.5 req/s if not specified
Call configure_provider — I will be asked directly for consent.

### Step 4: Test
Call test_provider with the generated config.

### Step 5: Iterate (if test fails)
Read the error message and hint carefully. Common fixes:
- "no match" on extraction: your regex is wrong, check the actual page source
- "HTTP 403/202": add browser_escape_hatch: true and Chrome TLS fingerprint
- "0 results": results_path is wrong, check the actual response structure
- "HTTP 401": auth extraction pattern failed, re-read the reference project
Retry up to 3 times, adjusting based on the specific error each time.

### Step 6: Save & Summary
Once test_provider passes, confirm success to me with the result count.
After all selected providers are done, show a summary of what is enabled
and working.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Some providers access services that restrict automated access in their
  Terms of Service. I will be informed about this and asked for consent
  before each provider is enabled.
- Provider configurations are generated by you (the AI assistant) based
  on publicly available information from open-source projects. They may
  not work on the first attempt if the target service has recently
  changed its API. This is expected.
- If a provider cannot be configured after several attempts, skip it
  and let me know — some services actively block automated access.
- All configured providers use rate limiting to be respectful of the
  target services.
