# trvl Price Watch

Use this skill when the user wants to monitor flights, hotel prices, specific
room availability, or rolling trip opportunities.

## Inputs

Load `get_preferences` first, then collect only the missing watch parameters:

- Watch type: flight, hotel, room availability, or opportunity window.
- Route or property name and location.
- Date or rolling window.
- Target price, currency, minimum score, or alert threshold.
- Passenger/guest count and bag posture when it changes all-in price.

## Workflow

1. For flight or hotel threshold alerts, call `watch_price`.
2. For a specific property and dates, call `watch_room_availability`.
3. For rolling windows across favourite or bucket-list destinations, call
   `watch_opportunities`.
4. Read back the active watch with `list_watches` or
   `list_opportunity_watches` so the user sees the saved threshold.
5. Give a /loop-compatible recurrence instruction:
   "Run `check_watches` daily; if a threshold is hit, summarize the delta and
   show the booking URL."

## Output

Return:

- Watch ID and type.
- Watched route/property/window.
- Target threshold and currency.
- First check cadence and the exact recurring `check_watches` or opportunity
  watch command pattern.
- Any missing data that prevents a durable watch.

Do not create or update saved preferences unless the user explicitly confirms
the profile change. If native trvl tools are unavailable, invoke the same tool
through `mcp__gateway__gateway_invoke` with `server="trvl"`.
