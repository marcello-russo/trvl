Asciinema source: [`demo.cast`](demo.cast) · Demo script and claims: [`docs/DEMO.md`](docs/DEMO.md)

> **The canonical travel MCP for AI assistants. 1 smart tool. 63 compatibility aliases. 21 providers. Zero API keys. One binary.**
>
> Gives Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and any MCP-compatible AI 1 smart MCP tool for your AI assistant — the `travel` router — with 63 compatibility aliases for flights, hotels, trains, buses, ferries, price alerts, award sweet spots, weather, baggage, lounges, and destination intel. Free. API-first. Also works as a standalone CLI with 50 commands.

**For**: AI-assistant users who book ≥4 trips/yr · AI-app builders integrating travel intent · devs shopping MCP registries.
**Not for**: humans booking via a website (use Google Flights) · travel-agency SaaS shoppers (we are not a hosted product).

```

```text
I have 80,000 Amex Membership Rewards points and 20,000 Virgin points. Compare award sweet spots from HEL to LHR in business class on August 15, 2026.
```

```text
Check whether AMS -> HEL -> RIX on July 1, 2026 is a sensible hidden-city option if I only have carry-on luggage, and compare it against a EUR 150 direct baseline.
```

```text
Find 3+ star hotels within 5 km of ExCeL London for July 1-4, 2026 for two guests, sorted by cheapest first.
```

```text
Create a mistake-fare watch for HEL -> BCN, July 1-8, 2026, and alert me if it drops below EUR 90.
```

trvl is an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) + CLI that gives Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant direct access to Google Flights, Google Hotels, Trivago, Airbnb, Booking.com, Hostelworld, Ferryhopper, and European ground transport data. It searches, optimizes, and applies travel hacks automatically — no personal API keys required, no monthly fees, API-first by default, with optional browser-assisted fallbacks only for a few protected providers.

## Setup

**One command — your AI does everything:**

> Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl/main/AGENTS.md and set up trvl

That's it. Your AI will install the binary, wire the MCP server, install the skill, build your travel profile, and verify everything works. Takes under a minute. Works in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and any AI with terminal access.

**Or tell your AI assistant:**

> Read https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl and install trvl as my travel MCP server

**Or install manually:**

```bash
brew install MikkoParkkola/tap/trvl   # install
trvl mcp install                       # wire to Claude Desktop (default)
```

`trvl mcp install` auto-detects your AI client. Specify one with `--client`:

```bash
trvl mcp install --client claude-code  # Claude Code
trvl mcp install --client cursor       # Cursor
trvl mcp install --client windsurf     # Windsurf
trvl mcp install --client codex        # OpenAI Codex CLI
trvl mcp install --client vscode       # VS Code Copilot
trvl mcp install --client zed          # Zed
trvl mcp install --client --list       # show all 10 supported clients
```

Also supported: `gemini`, `amazon-q`, `lm-studio`. Restart your client after install.

<details>
<summary>More install options</summary>

```bash
# Direct binary (no Homebrew)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl/releases/latest/download/trvl_$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz | tar xz -C /usr/local/bin trvl

# Go

# Docker
docker run --rm ghcr.io/mikkoparkkola/trvl flights HEL NRT 2026-06-15

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl.git && cd trvl && make build

# Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add trvl --transport stdio -- trvl mcp

# Manual JSON (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
# Add to your MCP client config:
# { "mcpServers": { "trvl": { "command": "trvl", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

</details>

### 3. (Optional) Teach your AI about trvl

If you used the one-command setup above, the skill is already installed. Otherwise, install the bundled skill that teaches Claude how to use trvl optimally, plus the provider-helper skill for safe optional provider setup:

```bash
# Install the bundled skills (Claude Code)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for s in trvl providers; do
  curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl/main/.claude/skills/$s.md" -o "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s.md"
done
```

Reference docs for other clients: [AGENTS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl/main/AGENTS.md) (full) · [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl/main/llms.txt) (compact)

### 4. Build your travel profile

trvl learns how you travel. On first use, the AI runs a short interview (4 phases, ~2 minutes) to understand your home airports, travel style, favourite cities, and booking strategies. It can also scan your email for past bookings.

```
Tell trvl to build my travel profile
```

The profile makes every subsequent search smarter — it skips questions it already knows the answer to, applies your preferences automatically, and suggests destinations based on your patterns.

### 5. Ask your AI to search

That's it. Your AI assistant now has 1 smart travel tool available. The old 63 tool names remain callable as compatibility aliases, and `TRVL_MCP_TOOL_MODE=legacy` restores the old advertised list for clients that require it. Just ask naturally:

- *"Search flights from JFK to Tokyo on July 1st, business class"*
- *"Find hotels in Paris for July 1-5, at least 4 stars"*
- *"What's the cheapest day to fly Helsinki to Barcelona in August?"*
- *"Where can I fly cheaply from Helsinki this weekend?"*
- *"How much would a week in Barcelona cost — flights and hotel?"*
- *"When should I fly to London? Check dates around July 15th"*
- *"Plan a trip: Helsinki -> Barcelona -> Rome -> Paris, cheapest routing"*
- *"Search buses from Prague to Krakow on May 3rd"*
- *"Compare train and bus prices Prague to Vienna"*
- *"Search flights from Amsterdam, Eindhoven, or Antwerp to Helsinki or Tallinn"*
- *"Show me travel deals from Helsinki under €400"*
- *"Alert me when flights to Tokyo drop below €500"*
- *"Import this booking confirmation into my Japan trip, then check whether the hotel candidate is still booking-ready"*

## Search Filters

### Flight Filters (`search_flights`)

| Filter | Parameter | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Cabin class | `cabin_class` | `economy`, `premium_economy`, `business`, `first` |
| Max stops | `max_stops` | `nonstop`, `one_stop`, `two_plus`, or `any` |
| Alliance | `alliances` | `STAR_ALLIANCE`, `ONEWORLD`, `SKYTEAM` — server-side |
| Departure time window | `depart_after` / `depart_before` | `HH:MM` format — server-side |
| Lower emissions | `less_emissions` | Only flights with below-average CO2 — server-side |
| Carry-on bags | `carry_on_bags` | Require N carry-on bags included — server-side price recalculation |
| Checked bags | `checked_bags` | **Hidden Google feature** — require N checked bags included, server-side. Google's own UI only exposes carry-on; trvl also wires the checked-bag slot in the same filter array. |
| Require checked bag | `require_checked_bag` | Client-side post-filter: drops any flight without ≥1 free checked bag in the parsed response |
| Max price | `max_price` | Integer, whole currency units — server-side |
| Max duration | `max_duration` | Minutes — server-side |
| Exclude basic economy | `exclude_basic` | Drops BE fares — server-side |
| Sort | `sort_by` | `cheapest`, `duration`, `departure`, `arrival` |
| Airlines | `airlines` | Comma-separated IATA codes (e.g. `AY,LH`) |

### Hotel Filters (`search_hotels`)

| Filter | Parameter | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Free cancellation | `free_cancellation` | `?fc=1` server-side Google Hotels param |
| Property type | `property_type` | `hotel`, `apartment`, `hostel`, `resort`, `bnb`, `villa` — server-side `?ptype=N` |
| Brand / chain | `brand` | Case-insensitive substring match (e.g. `hilton`, `marriott`) — client-side |
| Star rating | `stars` | Minimum 1-5 — server-side `?class=N` |
| Guest rating | `min_rating` | e.g. `4.0` — server-side `?rating=N` and client-side guard |
| Distance from center | `max_distance` | Kilometres — server-side `?lrad=N` (metres) |
| Amenities | `amenities` | Comma-separated required amenities — client-side |
| Price range | `min_price` / `max_price` | Per night — server-side `?min_price` / `?max_price` and client-side guard |
| Sort | `sort` | `price`, `rating`, `distance`, `stars` |

### Ground Transport Filters (`search_ground`)

| Filter | Parameter | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Mode | `type` | `bus`, `train`, `ferry` — client-side |
| Max price | `max_price` | Currency units — client-side |
| Provider | `provider` | Restrict to one provider (e.g. `flixbus`, `db`, `regiojet`) |

> **Unique feature:** The `checked_bags` filter on `search_flights` directly sets the checked-bags slot in Google's internal `batchexecute` filter array — the same wire position as carry-on bags. Google's own Flights UI only exposes the carry-on filter; the checked-bag slot works server-side but is undocumented and not surfaced in the UI. trvl is the only client that exposes it.

### MCP Protocol Features (v2025-11-25)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Structured content** | Typed JSON (`structuredContent`) alongside human-readable summaries |
| **Content annotations** | `audience: ["user"]` for summaries, `audience: ["assistant"]` for data |
| **Output schemas** | Full JSON Schema validation for the `travel` smart router and all 63 compatibility tool responses |
| **Prompts** | `plan-trip`, `find-cheapest-dates`, `compare-hotels`, `where-should-i-go` |
| **Resources** | Airport codes (50 major hubs), flight/hotel usage guides, price-watch subscriptions |
| **Tool description orchestration** | `find_trip_window` instructs the LLM to fetch calendar data first, then pass busy intervals in — works on every MCP client. See [docs/MCP-ORCHESTRATION.md](docs/MCP-ORCHESTRATION.md) |
| **Progress notifications** | Long-running searches stream progress tokens to the client |
| **Resource subscriptions** | Price-watch resources notify subscribers on price changes |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Suggestions for follow-up searches in every response |
| **Booking links** | Direct Google Flights/Hotels links in results |

## Travel Hack Detectors

`detect_travel_hacks` and `trvl hacks` run 37 detectors in parallel. Each one is independent and has a 20-second timeout:

| Detector | What it finds |
|----------|--------------|
| **throwaway** | Book a longer itinerary and skip the final leg (when the add-on is free) |

| **multimodal_positioning** | Ground transport to a hub + cheaper flight (train/ferry/bus) |
| **multimodal_open_jaw_ground** | Mix ground and air for open-jaw itineraries |
| **multimodal_return_split** | Different modes for outbound vs. return leg |
| **advance_purchase** | Identify routes where booking 14-21+ days ahead drops the fare significantly |
| **group_split** | Split a group across separate bookings for lower per-person fares |
| **rail_fly_arbitrage** | Train to a hub + flight cheaper than direct flight |

## Flight Providers

trvl ships with **Google Flights** (hand-rolled protobuf) on the default code path, augmented by **Kiwi** (virtual-interlining merge) for compatible one-way searches and **AFKLM Flying Blue** (Offers API v3, opt-in) for award-availability scans. Two additional providers are available as opt-ins for specific use cases:

| Provider | Protocol | Strength | Activation | Auth |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|------|
| **Google Flights** | hand-rolled protobuf | Broadest coverage, server-side filters | default | None |
| **Kiwi** | REST | Virtual-interlining + self-connect candidates | default (one-way merge) | None |
| **AFKLM Flying Blue** | Offers API v3 + Award API | Cash + miles cabin search on KL/AF metal | `--award` (CLI) / built-in opt-in | KLM/Flying Blue session cookie |
| **Skiplagged** | Streamable HTTP MCP (`@skiplagged/mcp` v0.0.4, protocol 2025-06-18) | Genre-defining hidden-city + virtual-interlining defaults | default (one-way merge) / `--provider skiplagged` for solo | None |

The default flight search merges results from Google Flights, Kiwi, and Skiplagged into a single sorted list, so plain `trvl flights HEL BCN 2026-07-01` already includes hidden-city / virtual-interlining options. Use `--provider skiplagged` to query Skiplagged on its own when you want to cross-validate or see only the hidden-city candidates.

```bash
# Default (Google Flights + Kiwi + Skiplagged merge):
trvl flights HEL BCN 2026-07-01

# Skiplagged hidden-city / virtual-interlining only:
trvl flights HEL BCN 2026-07-01 --provider skiplagged

# AFKLM Flying Blue award availability:
trvl flights AMS NRT 2026-09-15 --award
```

## Ground Transport Providers

trvl searches 20 ground transport providers in parallel, covering most of Europe. Airport transfers add taxi estimates on top of that, so trvl exposes 21 transport providers overall:

| Provider | Protocol | Coverage | Starting price | Auth |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|------|
| **Eurostar** | GraphQL | London ↔ Paris/Brussels/Amsterdam/Cologne | GBP 39+ | Browser cookies (Datadome) |
| **Deutsche Bahn** | REST (Vendo) | All European rail connections | EUR 37+ | None |
| **ÖBB** | REST (shop + HAFAS) | Austrian Railjet + cross-border (AT/DE/HU/IT) | EUR 38+ | None |
| **VR (via Digitransit)** | GraphQL | Finnish rail network | EUR 14+ | Public API key (embedded) |
| **NS** | REST | Dutch rail network | EUR 5+ | Public subscription key (embedded) |
| **Renfe** | REST | Spanish AVE high-speed + regional | EUR 36+ | None |
| **SNCF** | REST | French TGV, TER, Intercity | Varies | None by default; optional browser/curl fallback |
| **Trainline** | REST | Aggregated: SNCF, DB, Eurostar, Trenitalia, … | Varies | None by default; optional browser/curl fallback |
| **FlixBus** | REST | Pan-European buses (40+ countries) | EUR 5+ | None |
| **RegioJet** | REST | CZ/SK/AT/HU/DE/PL buses + trains | EUR 5+ | None |
| **Transitous** | MOTIS2 REST | Pan-European transit (schedule-based fallback) | — | None |
| **Tallink** | Booking SPA API | Baltic Sea ferries (Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, Riga) — future dates | EUR 16+ | Session cookie (auto) |
| **Viking Line** | Reference schedule | Baltic Sea ferries (Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, Turku) | EUR 22+ | None |
| **Eckerö Line** | Magento AJAX API | Helsinki ↔ Tallinn (M/S Finlandia) | EUR 19+ | None |
| **Stena Line** | Reference schedule | North Sea + Baltic (Gothenburg, Kiel, Karlskrona, Gdynia, …) | EUR 25+ | None |
| **Finnlines** | GraphQL (AppSync) | Helsinki ↔ Travemünde, Naantali ↔ Kapellskär, Malmö ↔ Świnoujście | EUR 27+ | Public API key (embedded) |
| **DFDS** | REST API | North Sea + Baltic (Kiel, Amsterdam, Newcastle, Copenhagen, …) | EUR 49+ | None |

Two providers (NS, Digitransit/VR) use public API keys that are embedded in the binary — no signup or personal key is required from the user.

```

## For AI Assistants

See [Quick Setup step 3](#3-optional-teach-your-ai-about-trvl) above for AGENTS.md and llms.txt links.

---

## CLI Usage

trvl also works as a standalone CLI tool with 50 commands:

All search commands accept `--currency <CODE>` (e.g. `--currency EUR`) to convert displayed prices. trvl detects the actual API currency and converts at the display layer — no hardcoded currencies.

### Buses, Trains & Ferries

Searches 20 providers in parallel: FlixBus (buses, pan-European), RegioJet (buses+trains, CZ/SK/AT/HU/DE/PL), Eurostar/Snap (trains, London↔Paris/Brussels/Amsterdam/Cologne), Deutsche Bahn (trains, all European rail), ÖBB (shop/HAFAS API), NS (Dutch railways), VR (Finnish railways, via Digitransit API), SNCF (trains, French TGV/TER), Trainline (aggregated rail across major European operators), Transitous.org (transit routing, pan-European), Renfe (Spanish AVE high-speed API), European Sleeper (night trains Brussels↔Berlin↔Prague + Amsterdam/Rotterdam/Antwerp/Dresden), Snälltåget (Swedish night trains Stockholm↔Malmö/Åre/Berlin, Sqills S3 API), Tallink (Baltic Sea ferries, live API), Viking Line (Baltic Sea ferries), Eckerö Line (Helsinki↔Tallinn, live Magento API), Finnlines (Helsinki↔Travemünde, Naantali↔Kapellskär, GraphQL API), Stena Line (North Sea + Baltic ferries), DFDS (North Sea + Baltic ferries, live availability API), and Ferryhopper (33 countries, 190+ ferry operators, via MCP). Airport transfers also add taxi fare estimates for door-to-door comparisons.

API routes are the default path. If you want trvl to try browser/curl/cookie-assisted fallbacks for protected providers such as SNCF or Trainline, pass `--allow-browser-fallbacks` (or set `TRVL_ALLOW_BROWSER_FALLBACKS=true`).

```bash
trvl ground Prague Vienna 2026-07-01                  # All 20 providers
trvl ground London Paris 2026-07-01                   # Eurostar + FlixBus + DB
trvl bus Prague Krakow 2026-07-01                     # Same command, bus alias
trvl train Prague Vienna 2026-07-01 --type train      # Trains only
trvl ground Prague Vienna 2026-07-01 --provider regiojet  # RegioJet only
trvl ground Vienna Salzburg 2026-07-01 --provider oebb    # ÖBB Railjet (EUR 38+)
trvl ground Helsinki Tampere 2026-07-01 --provider vr     # VR Finnish Railways (EUR 14+)
trvl ground Amsterdam Utrecht 2026-07-01 --provider ns    # NS Dutch Railways (EUR 5+)
trvl ground Paris Lyon 2026-07-01 --provider sncf         # SNCF TGV only
trvl ground Berlin Munich 2026-07-01 --provider db        # DB ICE (e.g. EUR 47.99)
trvl ground London Paris 2026-07-01 --provider trainline --allow-browser-fallbacks  # Trainline aggregated rail + optional protected fallback
trvl ground Madrid Barcelona 2026-07-01 --provider renfe   # Renfe AVE high-speed (EUR 36+)
trvl ground Prague Vienna 2026-07-01 --max-price 20       # Under EUR 20
trvl airport-transfer CDG "Hotel Lutetia Paris" 2026-07-01
trvl airport-transfer LHR "Paddington Station" 2026-07-01 --arrival-after 14:30
trvl airport-transfer CDG "Hotel Lutetia Paris" 2026-07-01 --provider taxi
```

### Multi-Modal Routing

Combines flights, trains, buses and ferries into optimal itineraries across all 20 providers. `--avoid` filters only the avoided mode, and `--depart-after` / `--arrive-by` are applied against the assembled itinerary times.

```bash
trvl route Helsinki Dubrovnik --arrive-by 2026-04-10     # Pareto-optimal itineraries
trvl route HEL TLL --arrive-by 2026-04-06               # Ferry + bus options
trvl route London Barcelona --arrive-by 2026-07-15       # Eurostar + TGV vs flight
```

### Price Watch

Track flight and hotel prices over time. Get alerts when prices drop below a threshold.

```bash
trvl watch add HEL BCN --depart 2026-07-01 --return 2026-07-08 --below 200
trvl watch add Prague --type hotel --depart 2026-07-01 --return 2026-07-02 --last-minute
trvl watch list                                       # Show all active watches
trvl watch check                                      # Check current prices
trvl watch daemon --every 6h                          # Keep checking on a schedule
trvl watch history <id>                               # Price history for a watch
trvl watch remove <id>                                # Remove a watch
```

### Travel Deals

Aggregates error fares, flash sales, and deals from 4 RSS feeds (Secret Flying, Fly4Free, Holiday Pirates, The Points Guy). Deals also appear automatically in flight search results when a matching deal is found.

```bash
trvl deals                                            # All recent deals
trvl deals --from HEL,AMS --max-price 400             # From my airports, under €400
trvl deals --from Helsinki,Amsterdam,Prague            # City names also accepted
trvl deals --type error_fare                           # Error fares only
```

### Travel Hacks

Runs 37 detectors in parallel and ranks savings opportunities. Pass `--return` for round-trip hacks. Add `--carry-on` to restrict hidden-city results to carry-on only.

```bash
trvl hacks HEL AMS 2026-04-13                         # One-way hacks
trvl hacks HEL AMS 2026-04-13 --return 2026-04-15 --carry-on  # Round-trip, carry-on
trvl hacks-accom Prague --checkin 2026-06-15 --checkout 2026-06-22  # Hotel split hacks
```

### Trip Persistence

Save and manage trips across sessions. Trips are stored in `~/.trvl/trips.json`.

```bash
trvl trips list                                       # List all saved trips
trvl trips show <id>                                  # Show trip details
trvl trips create "Helsinki → Prague → Amsterdam"     # Create a new trip
trvl trips add-leg <id> flight --from HEL --to PRG --date 2026-06-15
trvl trips book <id>                                  # Mark trip as booked
trvl trips delete <id>                                # Remove a trip
```

### User Preferences

Personal travel profile stored in `~/.trvl/preferences.json`. Drives real-time filtering: hotel results filtered by stars, rating, and neighborhood; hostels and airport hotels excluded; flight results filtered by budget and departure time window. Your AI assistant builds this profile automatically on first use (via `get_preferences` + `update_preferences` MCP tools).

```bash
trvl prefs                                            # Show current preferences
trvl prefs init                                       # Interactive setup wizard
trvl prefs edit                                       # Open in $EDITOR
```

Home airport and currency are auto-detected from your IP on first search. The AI assistant interviews you for the rest on first use. Examples of what the profile controls:

| Preference | What it does |
|---|---|
| `home_airports: ["HEL", "AMS"]` | Default origin for every search |
| `no_dormitories: true` | Drops hostels, capsule hotels, guesthouse rooms |
| `min_hotel_stars: 4` | Only 4-star+ hotels in results |
| `min_hotel_rating: 4.0` | Only well-reviewed properties (20+ reviews required) |
| `preferred_districts: {"Prague": ["Prague 1"]}` | Hotels in your favorite neighborhoods first |
| `carry_on_only: true` | Unlocks hidden-city and throwaway-ticket hacks |
| `prefer_direct: true` | Nonstop flights only |
| `budget_per_night_max: 150` | Hotel price cap passed to Google Hotels API |
| `budget_flight_max: 300` | Flights over budget dropped from results |
| `flight_time_earliest: "07:00"` | No 5am departures |
| `default_companions: 1` | Hotel searches default to 2 guests (you + companion) |
| `notes: "boutique hotels, no chains"` | Free-text — the AI applies these as soft filters |

### Points & Miles

Compare a redemption against paying cash, or list supported loyalty programs:

```bash
trvl points-value --cash 450 --points 20000 --program finnair-plus
trvl points-value --cash 300 --offer world-of-hyatt:12000 --offer hilton-honors:80000
trvl points-value --list
```

### Traveller Profile

Build a personal travel profile from your booking history. The profile learns your patterns — preferred airlines, favourite destinations, accommodation preferences, travel hacks — and uses them to skip redundant interview questions and personalize searches.

```bash
trvl profile                                          # Show your travel profile
trvl profile summary                                  # Quick stats
trvl profile add --type flight --provider KLM --ref ZHS9BM  # Add a booking manually
trvl profile import-email                             # Build profile from email history (LLM-assisted)
```

The profile stores:
- **Frequent flyer status**: Alliance tiers, programme memberships
- **Booking history**: Flights, hotels, Airbnb, ground transport, rides
- **Preferences**: Preferred airlines, apartment vs hotel, favourite neighbourhoods
- **Travel hacks used**: Fare tricks you've applied before
- **Family composition**: Travelling companions, unaccompanied minor experience
- **Seasonal patterns**: When you typically travel

## How It Works

Google's travel frontend uses an internal gRPC-over-HTTP protocol called **batchexecute**. `trvl` speaks this protocol natively:

1. **Chrome TLS fingerprint** — [utls](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls) impersonates Chrome's exact TLS ClientHello
2. **Flights** — `FlightsFrontendService/GetShoppingResults` with encoded filter arrays
3. **Hotels** — `TravelFrontendUi` embedded JSON parsing from `AF_initDataCallback` blocks
4. **Hotel prices** — `TravelFrontendUi/data/batchexecute` with rpcid `yY52ce`
5. **Explore** — `GetExploreDestinations` for destination discovery
6. **Destination info** — Parallel aggregation of 5 free APIs (Open-Meteo, REST Countries, Nager.Date, travel-advisory.info, ExchangeRate-API)
7. **Buses** — FlixBus public API (`global.api.flixbus.com`) with city autocomplete + search
8. **Trains (RegioJet)** — RegioJet public API (`brn-ybus-pubapi.sa.cz`) with route search + pricing
9. **Trains (Eurostar)** — `site-api.eurostar.com/gateway` GraphQL for London↔Paris/Brussels/Amsterdam/Cologne
10. **Trains (Deutsche Bahn)** — DB Vendo API (`int.bahn.de/web/api`) for all European rail connections
11. **Trains (ÖBB)** — Austrian Federal Railways via shop/HAFAS APIs; live Railjet fares (EUR 38+)
12. **Trains (NS)** — NS Dutch Railways public API (`gateway.apiportal.ns.nl`) with embedded subscription key
13. **Trains (VR)** — Finnish Railways via Digitransit GraphQL API (`api.digitransit.fi`); fixed fares from Matka.fi
14. **Trains (SNCF)** — SNCF Connect API for French TGV, TER, and Intercity routes; optional browser/curl fallback for protected sessions
15. **Trains (Trainline)** — Trainline aggregated rail API across major European operators; optional browser/curl fallback for protected sessions
16. **Transit (Transitous)** — `routing.spicebus.org` MOTIS2 API for pan-European transit routing
17. **Trains (Renfe)** — Spanish AVE high-speed and regional rail via REST API; fares EUR 36+
18. **Rate limiting** — per-provider token buckets (10 req/s FlixBus/RegioJet; 1 req/2s DB; 1 req/6s SNCF/Transitous; 1 req/20s Eurostar) with exponential backoff on 429/5xx

Most providers use pure HTTP/JSON APIs. Optional browser/curl-assisted fallbacks exist only for protected providers that sometimes require live cookies or verification (currently SNCF and Trainline); the default path stays API-first.

## Every Result is Bookable

Every flight and hotel result includes a `booking_url` — a direct link to Google Flights or Google Hotels where you can complete the booking:

```json
{
  "price": 113,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "airline": "Norwegian",
  "flight_number": "D8 2900",
  "booking_url": "https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=Flights+to+BCN+from+HEL+on+2026-07-01"
}
```

The AI uses these to give you actionable recommendations: "Book here: [link]". No copying flight numbers into another search engine.

## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Binary** | Single static ~15MB for API-first flows. Optional protected-provider fallbacks may use local browser/python tooling. |
| **Data** | Real-time from Google Flights + 5 hotel sources (Google Hotels, Trivago, Airbnb, Booking.com, Hostelworld) + 20 ground providers (FlixBus, RegioJet, Eurostar, DB, ÖBB, NS, VR, SNCF, Trainline, Transitous, Renfe, European Sleeper, Snälltåget, Tallink, Viking Line, Eckerö Line, Finnlines, Stena Line, DFDS, Ferryhopper) + 5 free destination APIs |
| **Auth** | No personal API keys required. Two providers (NS, Digitransit/VR) use public keys embedded in the binary. Optional browser/cookie fallbacks are available for protected providers when explicitly enabled. |
| **MCP** | Full v2025-11-25 — 1 smart MCP tool, 63 compatibility aliases (incl. 4 profile aliases, 3 price watch aliases, provider health, award sweet-spot scanning), 7 prompts, resources, structured content, progress notifications, resource subscriptions, tool description orchestration |
| **CLI** | 50 commands (+ 7 watch subcommands) with table/JSON output, color, shell completion |
| **Booking links** | Every flight and hotel result includes a direct Google booking link |
| **Travel hacks** | 37 detectors (throwaway, hidden-city, positioning, ferry, multi-modal, stopover, date-flex, error fare, back-to-back, rail competition, and more) |
| **Personal profile** | Learns from your booking history (email parsing + LLM). Remembers FF status, luggage needs, favourite properties, departure preferences, travel hacks used, accommodation preferences, family composition. Pre-search interviews skip questions the profile already answers. |
| **Output** | Pretty tables with color (default) or JSON (`--format json`) |
| **Platforms** | Linux, macOS (amd64, arm64). Windows CI in progress. |
| **Code** | Go codebase with CI race/coverage gates and a documented local test matrix in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) |
| **License** | PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0 |

## Legal

`trvl` is a **personal-use tool** that accesses public-facing web APIs from Google Flights, Google Hotels, and other travel providers. It does not bypass authentication, access protected content, or circumvent rate limits. Request patterns are rate-limited to be indistinguishable from manual browsing (0.5-2 req/s per provider).

**Important:** Automated access may violate some providers' Terms of Service. This tool is licensed under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0 — commercial use, operation as a service, or redistribution of scraped data is prohibited. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable terms and laws in your jurisdiction. Same approach as [fli](https://github.com/punitarani/fli) (1K+ stars, MIT licensed).

## Ecosystem

trvl is part of a suite of MCP tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [mcp-gateway](https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/mcp-gateway) | Universal MCP gateway — compact 12-15 tool surface replaces 100+ registrations |
| **[trvl](https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/trvl)** | **AI travel agent — 1 smart MCP tool plus 63 compatibility aliases for flights, hotels, ground transport** |
| [nab](https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/nab) | Web content extraction — fetch any URL with cookies + anti-bot bypass |
| [axterminator](https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/axterminator) | macOS GUI automation — 35 MCP tools via Accessibility API |

## Troubleshooting

**MCP server not showing tools?** Restart your AI client after running `trvl mcp install`. Verify the binary is on your `$PATH` with `which trvl`.

**Flight search returns empty results?** Some routes have no data in Google Flights. Try a major airport pair (e.g. `trvl flights HEL LHR 2026-07-01`) to confirm it works. Use `--format json` to see the raw response.

**"context deadline exceeded" on ground transport?** Ferry and rail providers sometimes throttle. Retry after 30 seconds, or use `--timeout 3m` for slow providers.

**Hotel search shows 0 results?** Check your dates — Google Hotels requires check-in in the future and at least 1 night. Try: `trvl hotels "London" --checkin 2026-07-01 --checkout 2026-07-03`.

**MCP server crashes on startup?** Run `trvl mcp` directly in your terminal to see the error. Common cause: port conflict when using `--http`. Try a different port with `--port 8081`. HTTP mode listens on `127.0.0.1` by default and requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; set `TRVL_MCP_TOKEN` or use the generated startup token.
